This project proposes the development of a decentralized voting platform, ChainBallot, designed to enhance electoral security, transparency, and efficiency. By utilizing blockchainâ€™s immutable ledger and smart contracts, the platform ensures tamper-proof voting records and automated processes. A unique feature of this system is the integration of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to verify voter eligibility. Only individuals possessing a specific NFT, issued before the election, can cast their votes, ensuring exclusivity and eliminating unauthorized participation.
